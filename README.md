# leaflet-challenge

Leaflet was used to visualize data from the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short.

Leaflet-Part-1 contains an HTML file and a static folder, which contains a folder for a CSS file and a folder for the main JavaScript file. Examples from other GitHub repositories were used to help develop the script.
